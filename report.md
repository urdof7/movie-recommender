Introduction
Content-based filtering and collaborative filtering are two popular methods for personalized recommendations. This report explores their methodologies, strengths, and weaknesses, providing a foundation for analyzing their performance in generating movie recommendations.

Design of Experiment
1. Dataset
A SQLite database containing movies, genres, directors, cast members, and user ratings was used.
Content-Based Filtering: Relied on movie features like genres, directors, and cast.
Collaborative Filtering: Used user ratings to identify patterns of shared preferences between users.
2. Implementation
Content-Based Filtering:

Built a user profile using highly rated movies (rating ≥ 4.0).
Calculated cosine similarity between the user profile and the features of other movies.
Generated recommendations based on similarity scores, normalized to match the user rating scale (1–5).
Collaborative Filtering:

Used the Surprise library's Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to predict ratings for unrated movies.
Recommendations were generated by selecting movies with the highest predicted ratings.
3. Evaluation
Both approaches are designed to recommend movies that align with user preferences.
Future testing will compare the recommendations using quantitative metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and qualitative measures like diversity and relevance.
Pros and Cons
Content-Based Filtering
Pros:
Does not require comparisons between users, making it effective for cold-start users (no shared rating history).
Transparent and explainable: Recommendations can be traced back to specific movie features.
Cons:
Limited diversity: Often recommends items similar to those the user already liked.
Struggles when item features are sparse or insufficient.
Collaborative Filtering
Pros:
Captures complex relationships between users and items.
Provides diverse recommendations by leveraging the preferences of similar users.
Cons:
Suffers from the cold-start problem (new users or items with no ratings).
Requires significant user-item interaction data for accuracy.
Conclusion
Both approaches have unique strengths and limitations. Content-based filtering excels in explainability and works well with limited user interaction, while collaborative filtering performs better with larger datasets and can recommend a broader range of items. The next step is to compare their performance through testing and analysis.
